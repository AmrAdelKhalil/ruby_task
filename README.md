#TASK2

**INSTRUCTIONS**

* You will find a file under `lib/project_algorithms` called `pricing_algorithm`
* I considered that both `brand` and `product_database` or objects like ActiveRecord objects, but `price_reference` is just an integer.
* I consider that this module will be included to another class that responsible for calculating `calculate_price` method.
* I needed to test this file but I got no models so I made a new version that could be tested under the `lib/project_algorithms/test` called `pricing_algorithm_test`.
